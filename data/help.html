			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="helpP">
				This document is made to explain in detail the operation of the GUI for controlling the Shear Stress Bioreactor.
				This document does <i>not</i> go over the details of the operation of the bioreactor from a biological or mechanical standpoint,
				nor does it contain instruction for assembling any component of the Shear Stress Bioreactor. For information about these topics, please see the documentation provided elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p class="helpP">
				The links at the top of the page should direct you to each specific section.

			<h2>Routine Manager</h2>
			<p class="helpP">
				The routine manager is used to create and execute 'routines', which are comprised of a desired flow rate, some amount of time to be on, some amount of time
				to be off, and a number of the cycles of on/off to do. The units of each field are described in the routine manager itself. 
				A short time after clicking 'execute routine' you should see the pump being to operate as requested. If the ESP is connected to the internet you can access graphs via ThingSpeak, which is linked on the home page as 'Graph Viewer.'
			</p>
			<a name="NetworkSettings"></a>
			<h2>Network Settings</h2>
			<p class="helpP">
				The network settings menu allows users to connect to WiFi networks, or turn on Access Point mode. Currently, only WiFi networks that
				require only ssid and password are available to be connected to. Many University networks require a username as well, but many also
				block devices from hosting web servers on the local network.
			</p>
			<p class="helpP">
				On reboot, the ESP will always start in access point mode. While in access point mode the ESP cannot send data to ThingSpeak.
				To send data, use the network settings page to connect the ESP to a wifi network. You can do this after setting up a routine and running it, or you can choose to only
				use the access point mode to connect to a network, then connect to the ESP from a machine connected to that network.
